# Sustainable AI – A Vision by Rehan Ansari

### 🧠 Purpose:
A model for **Sustainable Artificial Intelligence**, reducing AI’s waste (electricity, water, server overload) and increasing meaningful, high-value usage.

### 🌍 Problem:
AI is being overused for trivial tasks. Billions of casual queries waste huge resources. This slows down important work and harms the planet.

### 💡 Solution:
1. **Classify all queries** into levels:
   - Casual
   - Moderate
   - Pro
   - Advanced
2. **Offline default replies** for light questions.
3. **Full intelligence** for advanced and important ones.
4. Save power, reduce server traffic, and focus on meaningful human-AI collaboration.

### 📌 Benefits:
- Minimizes environmental waste
- Prevents AI overload
- Maximizes AI’s positive impact
- Human-aligned AI growth
